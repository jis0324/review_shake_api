I ordered Zeeks lot from the Chandler ( warner) location.  However, the last time I ordered in March, a liter of Pespi was delivered instead if Diet Pepsi.  Not a big deal and driver told me he would adjust my bill. No problem. Two days later, I called up Zeeks as the adjustment never occured.  Whoever I spoke to acted as if I did something wrong. He had an attitude and was rude. He said he could not adjust the bill (credit to my debit card) the day after a transaction. I've never heard of this lack of fucntionality. He told me he could not add a credit to my account.  He told me he could not note my account for future orders. Instead, he could mail me a gift card.  I asked if I could pick it up.  He said it has to be mailed.  Weird but okay.  Well I never received the gift card and have not ordered Zeeks since. I was ordering from then once a week, so their loss.  Good pizza though and owner seems very cool. Actually came out on a delivery once.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103334991856274719116/place/ChIJffj3upapK4cRT5kQAdUg5xI,,103334991856274719116,,zzeeks pizza gilbert

I love wings and tolerate pizza, so I fully expected to eat only wings while my family ate pizza, but when it came out and I tried a bite, I was hooked and filled up on pizza instead. Don't get me wrong, the medium buffalo wings were great too (with good ranch and blue cheese), but the pizza surprised me. We found our new favorite pizza and wing place! 😋",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105906302045159830721/place/ChIJffj3upapK4cRT5kQAdUg5xI,,105906302045159830721,,zzeeks pizza gilbert
