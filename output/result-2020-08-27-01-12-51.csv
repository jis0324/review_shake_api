Not a big deal and driver told me he would adjust my bill. No problem. Two days later, I called up Zeeks as the adjustment never occured.  Whoever I spoke to acted as if I did something wrong. He had an attitude and was rude. He said he could not adjust the bill (credit to my debit card) the day after a transaction. I've never heard of this lack of fucntionality. He told me he could not add a credit to my account.  He told me he could not note my account for future orders. Instead, he could mail me a gift card.  I asked if I could pick it up.  He said it has to be mailed.  Weird but okay.  Well I never received the gift card and have not ordered Zeeks since. I was ordering from then once a week, so their loss.
