Ordered a pizza &amp; fried pickles. Pizza was cold &amp; not prepared correctly &amp; the pickles were over fried. When I called to bring this up, didn&#39;t speak to a manager as he/she was too busy but he/she did tell the employee to offer me a free pizza. Would be mailed. Wonderful. However when I got the coupon in the mail, it&#39;s only for dine in or carry out only - not delivering. During Covid I am not going to dine in as well as carry outs it&#39;s not in the cards for my household as we need to stay quarantined for our health.

Overall, for the $5 amount is a good price but a tad smaller than I was expecting. Great small business and nice employees, however looking at their regular prices for the pizzas (think it&#39;s $12 for this same pizza normally) it is priced at the upper end.

I&#39;m from Long Island, NY and it&#39;s as close to NY pizza as you&#39;re going to get. Especially, the Brooklyn style crust. Not too thin and not too thick. I highly recommend their pizza. Haven&#39;t had anything else so can&#39;t comment on the rest of the menu.<br><br>I would give 5 stars but there are a couple of things they can improve on. First, only offering the Brooklyn crust in a 20&#34; isn&#39;t ideal considering it&#39;s just my wife and I and the 20&#34; is HUGE. It could feed 6 adults easy. They really need to offer the Brooklyn in smaller options.<br><br>Lastly, the app is easy to order but there&#39;s no option to view your order or past orders once you&#39;ve hit submit.

I ordered Zeeks lot from the Chandler ( warner) location.  However, the last time I ordered in March, a liter of Pespi was delivered instead if Diet Pepsi.  Not a big deal and driver told me he would adjust my bill. No problem. Two days later, I called up Zeeks as the adjustment never occured.  Whoever I spoke to acted as if I did something wrong. He had an attitude and was rude. He said he could not adjust the bill (credit to my debit card) the day after a transaction. I've never heard of this lack of fucntionality. He told me he could not add a credit to my account.  He told me he could not note my account for future orders. Instead, he could mail me a gift card.  I asked if I could pick it up.  He said it has to be mailed.  Weird but okay.  Well I never received the gift card and have not ordered Zeeks since. I was ordering from then once a week, so their loss.

A girl on the phone told my husband with an extremely bad attitude that no one could help us and wouldn't even hand the dang phone to a manager like we had requested. We called back an hour later and we finally got to talk to the manager. He was also extremely rude. He implyed we didn't actually buy anything when we would show proof of our repcipet but threw it away in THERE trash by the way. We have the charge on our bank account so don't try and play that bull that we didn't buy from here. He wasn't even budging to try and help.

I don’t know what all the hubbub is about: our whole experience was really just average.  We had minimal interactions with any staff who were your average friendly: nothing I’d consider “great”.  The food (pizza and cheese curds) was decent, not great, and quite expensive for what we got.  Nothing that made us want to go back again.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108852813891865384314/place/ChIJffj3upapK4cRT5kQAdUg5xI,,108852813891865384314,,zzeeks pizza gilbert

The reason I am still giving them 5 stars is their crust options. We love their broccoli/cheddar crust, and their cauliflower crust is good also. Having their nutritional values for their crusts listed is great! We eat pizza a lot, every week, so having a lower carb option has been great! Unfortunately this year my fiancee found out she has an autoimmune disorder and the doctors want her to do low carb(keto), and now we notice Zzeeks has Keto crust!!!   The Keto crust is my least favorite of their alternative crusts, but it isn't bad and we will gladly order it again. Now we just need to find out if any of their crusts are gluten free because now her doctors are telling her to cut gluten out also....",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112085549493412389261/place/ChIJffj3upapK4cRT5kQAdUg5xI,,112085549493412389261,,zzeeks pizza gilbert
