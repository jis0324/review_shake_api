146108342,Zesty Zzeeks Pizza & Wings,1242733825,Jules Nativio,2020-08-19,1.0,,"I have been waiting to leave this review until after the lockdown was lifted as I did not want to affect any business for them. I ordered Zeeks lot from the Chandler ( warner) location.  However, the last time I ordered in March, a liter of Pespi was delivered instead if Diet Pepsi.  Not a big deal and driver told me he would adjust my bill. No problem. Two days later, I called up Zeeks as the adjustment never occured.  Whoever I spoke to acted as if I did something wrong. He had an attitude and was rude. He said he could not adjust the bill (credit to my debit card) the day after a transaction. I've never heard of this lack of fucntionality. He told me he could not add a credit to my account.  He told me he could not note my account for future orders. Instead, he could mail me a gift card.  I asked if I could pick it up.  He said it has to be mailed.  Weird but okay.  Well I never received the gift card and have not ordered Zeeks since. I was ordering from then once a week, so their loss.  Good pizza though and owner seems very cool. Actually came out on a delivery once.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103334991856274719116/place/ChIJffj3upapK4cRT5kQAdUg5xI,,103334991856274719116,,zzeeks pizza gilbert

Unremarkable Dominoes-like sauce, original crust ok, average amount of toppings, no real distinctive flavor.  A pizza.  And an average one at best.  One level above Dominoes/PJohns.
